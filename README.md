1) **AWS Amplify**: A set of tools and services that simplify the development and deployment of scalable web and mobile applications on AWS, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

2) **AWS API Gateway**: A fully managed service for creating, securing, and managing APIs at any scale, enabling easy access to backend services like AWS Lambda and other AWS resources.

3) **AWS Lambda**: A serverless, event-driven compute service that automatically runs your code in response to API calls or other events, eliminating the need to manage servers.

4) **DynamoDB**: A fully managed, serverless NoSQL database designed for high-performance applications, offering seamless scalability and low-latency data access.
